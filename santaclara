This is attempt to create new file.
Yes, this might be public, so ok.
I already sent you email regarding GitKraken, & if ok with did sign in permission with GitHub, instead of new account.
also my concerns regarding Existing access <Access user email addresses (read-only)>
after that, did try to access Kuro-Neko with GitKraken. have not yet solved.
so decided to go back & begin to learn GitHub. hence THIS you are reading.
I'll use this, for now, as a notes, tasks, ideas, communication. I do realize might be public, so will treat as such.
also, when out today, I started to write notes on WebGL projects to build. in a very tiny step by step method.
as in many mini experiments.
also did same with a Reminderster project. drawback would be, can the ideas translate late to an app?
don't know. but if you are interested, can get you started on either. or wait and find out what you have started to build.
